This website showcases my work as a Sustainability and Backend Engineer specializing in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and carbon accounting calculation engines and data pipelines. Built with Astro and styled using Tailwind CSS, the site highlights my projects, skills, and expertise.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ # Static assets like images
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ # Web components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ # Layout templates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ # Page files, each representing a route
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory to create routes. Components and layouts are organized in their respective directories.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

Use these commands to manage the project:
